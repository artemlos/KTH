A class diagram illustrates the relationship between classes in general. As it can be seen in Figure 1, we can see that Student class is a part of a Lab class. An object diagram, in contrast to a class diagram, displays the way objects look like at a certain point in the objects' lifecycle. Figure 2 clearly shows that in that particular case, there are three Student objects that have signed up for a Lab Class session.

\section{Exercise 3.2}
A class diagram can change when the class is changed or the way the classes are connected.
