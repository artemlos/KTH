* partial sums:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n 

n(n+1)/2 = O(n^2)

There is no good case or bad case. it will  iterate the same ammount
no matter the size nor items in the array. theoretically.


a better algorithm:
B[0] = A[1]
for i=1 to n
 B[i] = B[i-1]+A[i]


* x abs(sinx)


n^3 + n ^2 n = O (n^3)
 O (n^3) = n^3 + n ^2 n

= O(n^3)

= n^2 + O( n^2)

n^

n
n^2 / 2 <
