// FIXME
// I've found two insidious bugs in this function; both of them are unlikely

// write a doc comment this time.
// Bug 1: the go routines (access shared memory *res) can overwrite the old result after timeout.
// instead, we will avoid sharing memory by sending information through the channel "done".
// Bug 2: Unbuffered channel makes the receiver wait until operation is finished. Get says that it
// will block forever if server does not respond -> not good, the whole client will stop. This, add
// a buffer (with one slot). This will not exhibit this blocking effect.
