* gv and in are stored in RAM. because RAM allows read-write.
* fun and main are stored on Program Flash, which is code and read only. the data is the instruction being pointed at.
* p and m are at reserved memory. p and m are bigger because are at a diff. section of memory than gv and in.
* p is pointing to the address of m. (double pointer.)
* p points to the same value ,but the value  of  m has incremented
* data pointers are always 32 bits in PIC32.
* each char takes 1 Byte, and we have 3 of them in addition to the null character. thus 4 are needed.
* it's a little endian because the lsb (cd) starts at the lowest address.
